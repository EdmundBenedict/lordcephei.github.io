_____________________________________________________________

### _Purpose_
{:.no_toc}

This page details the output generated by the free atomic code **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"}.

_____________________________________________________________

### _Table of Contents_
{:.no_toc}
*  Auto generated table of contents
{:toc} 

The output documented here is mostly taken from the **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"}
[tutorial](/tutorial/lmgf/lmgf/).
Some portions are adapted from other calculations, as will be indicated.

The standard output is organised by blocks.  The sections below
annotate each block approximately in the order they are made.
Some parts are similar to the [**lmf**{: style="color: blue"} output](/docs/outputs/lmf_output/); in places where they are similar a cursory
treatment is given here; the reader is referred to that page.

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} This document is annotated for an [output vebosity](/docs/commandline/general/#switches-common-to-most-or-all-programs) of 35 (medium verbosity)
Raising the verbosity causes **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} to print additional information.
Verbosity 31 is a little terse; verbosity 41 is a little verbose.


### _Preprocessor's transformation of the input file_
{::comment}
/docs/outputs/lmgf-output/#preprocessors-transformation-of-the-input-file
{:/comment}

The input file is run through the [preprocessor](/docs/input/preprocessor/), which modifies the ctrl file before it it is parsed for tags.
Normally it does this silently.  To see the effects of the preprocessor use `lmgf --showp ...`
