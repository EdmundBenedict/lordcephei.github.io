### _Prerequisite_

To calculate the optical and electronic properties through the **OPTICS** mode a full selfc-consistent calculation is needed.
For this tutorials the **lm**{: style="color: blue"} or  **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} are needed (the same executable as for the self-consistent calculation should be used). For this tutorial PbTe will be used for the porpuses of demonstration, instruction for self-consistent calculation for PbTe can be found [here](/tutorial/asa/lm_pbte_tutorial/).

### _Tutorial_

#### _Introduction_

The full-optential (FP) and the atomic spherical approximation (ASA) implementations of the code executed through  **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} and  **lm**{: style="color: blue"} respectivily, have the capacity to preform a number of equlibrium and non-equlibrim optical and electronic calculations. This tutorial will only focus on the equilibrium calculation for optical properties and the joint density of states (JDOS), non-equlibrium modes will be covered here(HYPERLINKTHIS).

#### _Input File_

Using the optics mode for calculating JDOS or the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function  can be done in two steps. The first step is to include a new category in the control file with associated tokens, an example of what needs to be included for a simple calculation is shown below:

      OPTICS  MODE=1 NPTS=1001 WINDOW=0 1 LTET=3

the category above describes all neccessery information needed to calculate the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function. The tokens above indicate an optics calculation mode 1 which is the imaginary part of the dielectric function, calculated for an energy range of 0-1 Ry (indicated by WINDOW token) with an enegy mesh density of 1001 using the  enhanced tetrahedron integration method (determined through LTET). Further more the token **FREE=F** should be added to the start category in the control file.

#### _Preforming calculations_

To preform this calculation simply add the text above to the ctrl file (in this tutorial we will use **lm**{: style="color: blue"} and GaAs) and invoke:

    lm -vnit=1 ctrl.pbte

or equevilantly for the FP implementation

   lmf -vnit=1 ctrl.gas

(**NOTE**: the **START** category is not used in full-potential calculations and hence can be ignored)additional switches are added to restrict the number of iteration to one, it is also recomended to include the switch  **- -rs=1,0** for FP calculations which will read the saved density from disk but will not update the electron density; this insures that all calculations after self-consistent calculation are preformed on the same density.

#### _Output file_

The output file of the optics mode can vary by mode, for the mode above the file will be named opt.pbte, and will contain 4 columns and 1002 rows. The first row contains brief metadat; the columns from left to right are enery value (in Ry), followed by values for the imaginary part of the dielectric function for three orientations of the electric field polarization.

#### _Further Optic Modes_

##### _Imaginary part of the dielectric function_
The optics ppmode=1 used above calculates the dielectric function for the cases of unpolarized spin (**HAM_NSPiN=1**) or analytic implementation of SOC(**HAM_SO=1**), in the cases of polarized spin or pertubation based implemetation of SOC **OPTICS_MODE=1** only calculates Im$\eps$ for spin up, to preform the same calculation for spin down electrons **OPTICS_MODE=2** must be used.

##### _Single and Joint Density of States(DOS)_

It is possible to calculate  Single DOS and the Joint DOS (JDOS) through the optics category of the control file. These calculations are preformed by simply using **OPTICS_MODE-1** to **-4** for JDOS calculations, and **-5** and **-6** for density calculations and running the **lm**{: style="color: blue"} or **lm**{: style="color: blue"} as describe for Im$\eps$ calculations above.
The six modes described above correlate to

    ppmode=:
       		-1: generate JDOS, similarly to ppmode=1 this generates complete JDOS in case of unpolarized spins and  ppso=1, otherwise JDOS for spin 1
       		-2: generate JDOS for spin 2, similarly to ppmode=2 this generates JDOS for the second spin  in cases ofpolarized spin and ppso=3
       		-3: generate JDOS between spin 1 and spin 2
       		-4: generate JDOS between spin 2 and spin 1
       		-5: generate single DOS for spin 1
       		-6: generate single DOS for spin 2

The output files for all six optic ppmodes described above  consiste of 2 columns ( the number of rows is **OPTICS_NPTS** plus and additional meta data line), the first of which is energy (in Ry) followed by the corresponding JDOS or DOS values.

#### _Resolving output_
Both **lm**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} offer a range of option to resolve Im$\eps$,DOS and JDOS through **OPTICS_PART**, **OPTICS_FILBND** and **OPTICS_EMPBND**, the options described here apply to all of the optic modes described above (Im$\eps$,JDOS and DOS).

##### _Occupied and unoccupied bands_

It is possible to perform any of the optics mode calculations described above for a restricted number of bands, this can greatly speed up the calculation and allow for isolation and identification of individual band contributions. To restric the bands involved in the calculation simply provide a range of values for occupied and unoccupied bands through **OPTICS_PART**, **OPTICS_FILBND** and **OPTICS_EMPBND** respectively. Below is an example of an optics category which calculates the contribution to  Im$\eps$ from the highest two valence bands and the lowest two conduction bands for silicon:

      OPTICS  MODE=1 NPTS=1001 WINDOW=0 1 LTET=3
              FILBND=9,10 EMPBND=11,12
              
The optics output file generated with restricted bands will have the same name and format as unrestricted band calculations, which has been described previously in this tutorial.

##### _Resolve by k,$\eps$ and band to band contibution_
The optical and electronic properties described above can also be sperated by band to band contribution through **OPTICS_PART=1**, this method has the advantage that the band to band contributions for a number of bands can be preformed quickly. The output of optical calculations while using **OPTICS_PART=1** is popt.pbte, the format of this file differes from opt.pbte. Details of output format for **OPTICS_PART=1** can be found [here](https://lordcephei.github.io/opt-part/).

The contributions to the optical and electronic properties can also be resolved by contributions from single k-points, this can be acheived by preforming the optical calcualtions above with the added switch **OPTICS_PART=2**. A full tuorial for this option os provided [here](https://lordcephei.github.io/opt-part/).

Finally options **OPTICS_PART=1** and **OPTICS_PART=2** can be preformed simultaniously, the output of this option is descibed [here](https://lordcephei.github.io/opt-part/).
