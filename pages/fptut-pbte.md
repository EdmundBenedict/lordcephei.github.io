### _Purpose_
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial carries out a self-consistent density-functional calculation for PbTe using the _lmf_{: style="color: green"} code.  Some of the basics are covered in this tutorial, and you may wish to go through it first.  This tutorial

1. generates a self consistent potential within the LDA

2. illustrates some features of the programming language capabilities in reading the input file

3. demonstrates how to get neighbour tables using the _lmchk_{: style="color: green"} tool

4. synchronizes with an [ASA tutorial](https://github.com/lordcephei/lordcephei.github.io/blob/master/pages/fptut-pbte.md) enabling a comparison of the ASA and full potential methods.

5. is the starting point for other tutorials on optics, corresponding calculations with QSGW, and drawing energy bands.
