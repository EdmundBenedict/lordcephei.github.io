# Basic introduction to full-potential program lmf 

This tutorial carries out a band structure calculation for silicon. The goal is to provide a simple introduction to the input and output files and the basics of running the code. It is assumed that you have installed the executables and that they are in your path (see installing tutorial for more). The starting point is a structure file called init.si. The init file contains basic structural information in a format that is recognised by the Questaal program (it is analogous to the POSCAR file for VASP). You can convert other standard structure files into an init file using conversion tools that are supplied as part of the suite of programs. See the /path/ page for more information on file conversion and an example of how to create a structure file manually. Below is a complete list of the commands that will be carried out.
