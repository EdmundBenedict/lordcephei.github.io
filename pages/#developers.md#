The development and expansion of LM Suite has been led by Mark van
Schilfgaarde since its inception. During his time with Ole Anderson’s
group at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Institute
(1987-1988), Mark implemented Ole’s new tight-binding formulation of
the LMTO-ASA method.  This code served as the foundation for the
well known Stuttgart LMTO-ASA package, and for many descendents of it,
including an ASA-GW code by Aryasetiawan, the original formulation of LDA+U, an
early formulation of noncollinear magnetism and of linear response for
spin waves, and a the first implementation of excact exchange.

There have been many contributors;  a partial list is provided below:
