The development and expansion of Questaal Suite has been led by Mark van
Schilfgaarde since its inception. During his time with Ole Anderson’s
group at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Institute
(1987-1988), Mark implemented Ole’s new tight-binding formulation of
the LMTO-ASA method.  This code served as the foundation for the
well known Stuttgart LMTO-ASA package, and for many descendents of it,
including an ASA-GW code by Aryasetiawan, the original formulation of LDA+U, an
early formulation of noncollinear magnetism and of linear response for
spin waves, and a the first implementation of excact exchange.

There have been many contributors; a partial list is provided below, in approximate chronological order.

[Mark van Schilfgaarde](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/people/academicstaff/van-Schilfgaarde-.aspx) *(King’s College London, U.K.)*  Primary Developer

[Takao Kotani](http://newton.damp.tottori-u.ac.jp/wiki/index.php/Tkotani) *(Tottori University, Japan)*  Primary developer of the GW package.
Professor Kotani maintains his code at github.com/tkotani/ecalj.  Both the one-body and the GW code were the same in 2007.
They have diverged since then but have many similarities.

[Dimitar Pashov](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/dimitar.pashov.html) *(King’s College London, U.K.)*
Primary developer of the tight-binding package and the Jigsaw Puzzle Orbitals.  Primary Questaal suite maintainer.

[Walter Lambrecht](http://physics.case.edu/faculty/walter-lambrecht/) *(Case Western Reserve, Ohio)* 
Added several features to the ASA and full-potential codes, e.g. LDA+U and the optics packages.

Primary developer of implementation of phonons and the electron-phonon interaction into the GW package

[Athanasios Chantis](https://journals.aps.org/prb/staff) *(Editor, Physical Review)*
Implementation of the fully relativistic Dirac equation into the ASA package, for studying transport
