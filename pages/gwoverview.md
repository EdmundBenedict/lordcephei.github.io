### _Introduction_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
The _GW_ approximation is implemented in two forms: as a 1-shot perturbation to the LDA and as quasiparticle self-consistent _GW_.

In 1-shot mode, the diagonal part of &Sigma; is evaluated at the
one-particle (usually LDA) energies, yielding a correction to the
LDA levels in 1st order perturbation theory.

In QSGW mode, the full &Sigma; matrix is calculated and
"quasiparticlized:" $$\Sigma_{ij}(\omega)$$ coupling one-electron
states _i_ and _j_, is evaluated at the one-particle energies
$$\varepsilon_{i}$$ and $$\varepsilon_{j}$$, and the average value is
taken.  This results in a static but orbital-dependent potential, a
"quasiparticlized" $$\Sigma^0_{ij}$$ derived from $$\Sigma_{ij}(\omega)$$,
and defines a one-particle hamiltonian $$H_0$$ which is the
LDA one-particle hamiltonian with $$\Sigma^0_{ij}$$ substituting for $$V^{LDA}_{xc}$$.

The new $$H_0$$ is used to mke a new $$\Sigma_{ij}(\omega)$$, and the process is iterated until 
$$H_0$$ stops changing.  This is quasiparticle self-consistency.

QS<i>GW</i> theory is an elegant way to find the optimum noninteracting hamiltonian $$H_0$$ for <i>GW</i> calculations.  It is vastly better
than basing $$H_0$$ on the LDA, as is customary, albeit at some computational cost.  A particularly valuable property of this optimum starting point is that the peaks
of the interacting Green's function <i>G</i> coincide with the poles of $$G_0$$.  The eigenfunctions of $$G_0$$ are as close as possible to
those of <i>G</i>, by construction.  What are true poles in $$G_0$$ get broadened by the interactions, so quasiparticles lose weight.  Thus the
density-of-states, or spectral function, is composed of a superposition of &delta;-functions for $$G_0$$, but are broadened for <i>G</i>.
Also the eigenvalues acquire an imaginary part, making the QP lifetime finite.

In QS<i>GW</i> theory $$G_0$$ and <i>G</i> are closely linked.  Associated with the two kinds of <i>G</i> are two kinds of density-of-states
(DOS).  There is "noninteracting" or "coherent" DOS, namely the spectral function of $$G_0$$ which is associated with DOS in one-particle description, and is what
is typically calculated by a band program such as **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} .  There is also the true DOS (spectral function of <i>G</i>) which is what is
approximately measured by e.g.  a photoemission experiment.  The <i>GW</i> package has a facility to generate both kinds of DOS; through the
normal **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} process for the noninteracting DOS or by analyzing the spectral functions for the interacting case.

A detailed description of QS<i>GW</i> theory and the way in which Questaal implements it
can be found in the references in "Other Resources" below.

### _How the 1-particle and many-particle codes synchronise_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
The _GW_ package comprise a separate set of codes from the density-functional code, **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}.  It uses the
single-particle basis set of **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} to calculate the screened coulomb interaction _W_ and the self-energy,
&Sigma;=_iGW_.

Thus, the _GW_ package handles the many-body part, **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} the 1-body part.  The two connect through special
purpose interfaces: **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"} sets up the inputs needed by GW, supplying information about the wave functions in the
augmentation spheres and in the interstitial.  The _GW_ part estimates shifts in  QP levels and
makes the quasiparticlized $$\Sigma^0_{ij}$$. 
Apart from these linkages, the <i>GW</i> package is completely separate from **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}.  The <i>GW</i> package 
has a separate input file, _GWinput_{: style="color: green"}  and does not depend on
the ctrl file **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"} use; only on the eigenfunctions they generate.

In reality the _GW_ package makes $$\Sigma^0{-}V^{LDA}_{xc}$$.  **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} can read this potential and add it to the LDA hamiltonian.
This construction enables **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} to do the same kinds of calculations it performs with the LDA potential.

#### _Operation of **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"}_

**lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"}  initially operates in the same manner as **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}.  After setting up the potential
it prompts for a job, which tells **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"}  what to do.

+ Job &minus;1 generates _GWinput_{: style="color: green"} and exits
+ Job 0&nbsp; is an 'initializer' mode.  It creates several input files the <i>GW</i> package requires: _SYMOPS_{: style="color: green"}, _LATTC_{: style="color: green"}, _CLASS_{: style="color: green"}, _NLAindx_{: style="color: green"}, _ldima_{: style="color: green"}
+ Job 1&nbsp; generates files required by the <i>GW</i> package (e.g. eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and wave function information)
+ Job &minus;2 performs sanity checks on _GWinput_{: style="color: green"}

Even while the _GW_ package is independent of **lmf**{: style="color: blue"},
the _GWinput_{: style="color: green"} file is complicated and
in practice almost always autogenerated by **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"}.
What **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"} writes to 
_GWinput_{: style="color: green"} _is_ modified by contents in the ctrl file.
 **lmfgwd**{: style="color: blue"} reads a special **GW** category from the ctrl file; 
through tags in this category you can set some of the parameters it writes into
_GWinput_{: style="color: green"} .

### _Analysis of many-body spectral functions_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
A pair of executables **spectral**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmfgws**{: style="color: blue"} 
are included in the Questaal suite.  They generate spectral functions, derived either
individual QP levels or integrated over the Brillouin zone to make the interacting density-of-states.
