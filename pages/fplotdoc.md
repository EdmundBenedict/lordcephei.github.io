### _Purpose_
{:.no_toc}

**fplot**{: style="color: blue"} is a general purpose plotting package, with functionality similar to **gnuplot**{: style="color: blue"}.
It is provided here because the tool synchronises smoothly with the rest of the Questaal codes such as **plbnds**{: style="color: blue"}
and **pldos**{: style="color: blue"}.  

For standard functions such as plotting bands or densities-of-states, tutorials show how to use standard packages; you do not need to use **fplot**{: style="color: blue"}.
But **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} it provides some functionality not readily obtained in **gnuplot**{: style="color: blue"}, e.g.
to determine cylclotron masses, plotting bands with color weights, and using the programming language features of the Questaal suite.
