### _Purpose_
{:.no_toc}

**fplot**{: style="color: blue"} is a general purpose plotting package, with functionality similar to **gnuplot**{: style="color: blue"}.
It is provided here because the tool synchronises smoothly with the rest of the Questaal codes such as **plbnds**{: style="color: blue"}
and **pldos**{: style="color: blue"}.  

For standard functions such as plotting bands or densities-of-states, tutorials use **gnuplot**{: style="color: blue"} or **fplot**{: style="color: blue"};

For some purposees **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} provides some functionality not readily obtained in **gnuplot**{: style="color: blue"}, e.g.
to determine cyclotron masses, plotting bands with color weights, and using the programming language features of the Questaal suite.

### 1. _Preliminaries_

It is assumed that you have **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} in your path.  

You will need some capability to display postscript files.   **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} generates a file _fplot.ps_{: style="color: green"}.

### 2. _Introduction_

**fplot**{: style="color: blue"} is mainly design to draw _xy_ data; it has some capability for contour plots and a very limited ability
for 3D graphics.

**fplot**{: style="color: blue"} is command-line driven and can efficiently generate figures from command-line arguments.  It can also read
arguments from a file script; this is necessary if the figure is complex.  **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} can make full use of the programming
language capability it has for reading input files, both in the script and in data files.

Other programs, especially **plbnd**{: style="color: blue"} and **pldos**{: style="color: blue"}, make **fplot**{: style="color: blue"}
script to make the process of drawing bands and figures very easy and efficient, with the capability of refining the figure by tuning the
autogenerated plotting script.

the sizeable number of command-line arguments **fplot**{: style="color: blue"} will accept are explained.
Here a couple of examples are given to you an intuitive feel of how the code operates and many of the settings you typically want to control yourself.

### 2.1 _Example:_ &nbsp; plot  $$y=20\,x^2\exp(-4x)$$

The following will plot this function in the interval (0,2), with the abscissa spaced in intervals of 0.02:

    $ fplot -ord '20*x^2*exp(-4*x)' -tp 0:2:.02; open fplot.ps 
    $ open fplot.ps 

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('fig1'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click here to see the figure.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="fig1">{:/} 
![Example 2.1](https://lordcephei.github.io/assets/img/fplot1.svg)
{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}


Some useful points to note:

+ A square box is drawn around the Figure.  You can select the width and height of the box; see `-frme` below.
+ By default all four edges of the box are drawn.  You can draw any combination of the four (`-frmt`).
  You can also draw the abscissa and ordinate through some middle point (`-frme:xor` and `-frme:yab`)
+ The abscissa and ordinate have tic marks, both major and minor.  You have considerable flexibility in controlling them (`-tmx` and `-tmy`)
+ The major tic marks are numbered.  There is considerable flexibility in controlling the font (`-font`) 
  and format (`-fmtnx` and `-fmtny`) of the numbers, whether they are suppressed (`-noxn` and `-noyn`) and where they are placed (`-xn` and `-yn`)
+ The line type is a simple solid line.  You can control many aspects of the line type (`-lt`)
+ The abscissa ranges from -0.1 to 2.1; the ordinate from -0.033 to +0.71. They were found automatically by finding the largest and smallest
  values in the frame, and padding the frame by 10%.  You can specify the padding (`-pad`) and/or the ranges (`-x` and `-y`)
