### _Purpose_
_____________________________________________________________

This tutorial carries out a self-consistent density-functional calculation for PbTe using the **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} code.
It has a purpose [similar to the basic tutorial](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_tutorial/) but shows some additional features.   It:

1. explains the input file's structure and illustrates some of its programming language capabilities
2. generates a self consistent potential within the LDA
3. makes neighbour tables using the **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} tool
4. synchronizes with an [ASA tutorial](/tutorial/asa/lm_pbte_tutorial/) on the same system, enabling a comparison of the ASA and full potential methods.
5. forms the starting point for other tutorials on optics, a QSGW calculation of PbTe, and compares energy bands computed in different ways.

### _Preliminaries_
_____________________________________________________________

Some of the basics are covered in the basic [lmf tutorial for Si](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_tutorial/), which you may wish to go through first.

Executables **blm**{: style="color: blue"}, **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"}, **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"}, and **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} are required and are assumed to be in your path.

### _Tutorial_

#### 1. _Building the input file_
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#building-the-input-file
{:/comment}

PbTe crystallizes in the rocksalt structure with lattice constant _a_ = 6.428&#x212B;. You need the structural information in the box below to construct the main input file,
_ctrl.pbte_{: style="color: green"}. Start in a fresh working directory and cut and paste the box's contents to _init.pbte_{: style="color: green"}.

    LATTICE
	    ALAT=6.427916  UNITS=A
            PLAT=    0.0000000    0.5000000    0.5000000
                     0.5000000    0.0000000    0.5000000
                     0.5000000    0.5000000    0.0000000
    SITE
		ATOM=Pb   X=     0.0000000    0.0000000    0.0000000
		ATOM=Te   X=     0.5000000    0.5000000    0.5000000

The primitive lattice vectors are in row format (i.e. the first row contains the _x_, _y_ and _z_ components of the first lattice vector and so forth). In the **SITE** section, the atom type and coordinates are shown. **X=** specifies the site coordinates.  They are specified in "direct" representation, i.e., as fractional multiples of lattice vectors **PLAT**.  You can also use Cartesian coordinates; instead of **X=** you would use **POS=** (see additional exercises below).  Positions in Cartesian coordinates are in units of **ALAT**, like the lattice vectors.

Use the **blm**{: style="color: blue"} tool as in the box below to create the input file (_ctrl.pbte_{: style="color: green"}) and the site file (_site.pbte_{: style="color: green"}):

    $ blm init.pbte
    $ cp actrl.pbte ctrl.pbte

#### 2. _How the input file is organized_

In this tutorial, **blm**{: style="color: blue"} is used in "standard" mode. (The [basic tutorial](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_tutorial/)
creates a simpler file with `blm --express init.si`). 
Standard mode makes limited use of the [preprocessing capabilities](/docs/input/inputfile/) of the Questaal input system : 
it uses algebraic variables which can be modified on the command line. Thus `lmf -vnit=10 ...` sets variable **nit** to 10 before doing anything else.
Generally:

* Lines which begin with '**#**' are comment lines and are ignored. (More generally, text following a `#' in any line is ignored).
s* Lines beginning with '**%**' are directives to the [preprocessor](/docs/input/preprocessor/).

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('variablesexplained'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click here
to see how variables can be set and used in the ctrl file.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:5px;" id="variablesexplained">{:/} 

The beginning of the ctrl file you just generated should look like the following:

~~~
# Variables entering into expressions parsed by input
% const nit=10
% const met=5
% const so=0 nsp=so?2:1
% const lxcf=2 lxcf1=0 lxcf2=0     # for PBE use: lxcf=0 lxcf1=101 lxcf2=130
% const pwmode=0 pwemax=3          # Use pwmode=1 or 11 to add APWs
% const nkabc=0 gmax=0
~~~ 

**% const** tells the proprocessor that it is declaring one or more variables.  **nit**, **met**, etc,  used in expressions later on.  The parser interprets the contents of brackets **{...}** as algebraic expressions: The contents of **{...}** is evaluated and the numerical result is substituted for it.  Expression substitution works for input lines proper, and also in the directives.  

For example this line

    metal=  {met}                    # Management of k-point integration weights in metals

becomes

    metal=  5

because **met** is a numerical expression (admittedly a trivial one).  It evaluates to 5 because **met** is declared as an algebraic variable and assigned value 5 near the top of the ctrl file.  The advantage is that you can do algebra in the input file, and you can also re-assign values to variables from the command line, as we will see shortly.

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

Lines corresponding to actual input are divided into **categories**{: style="color: red"}
and **tokens**{: style="color: blue"} within the categories.
A category begins when a character (other than **%** or **#**) occurs in the
first column.  Each token belongs to a category; for example in box below **IO**{: style="color: red"} contains three tokens, 
**SHOWMEM**{: style="color: blue"}, **IACTIV**{: style="color: blue"} and **VERBOS**{: style="color: blue"} :

    IO    SHOWMEM=f
          IACTIV=f VERBOS=35,35

(Internally, a complete identifier (aka _tag_) would be **IO_IACTIV=**, though it does not appears in that form in the ctrl file.)

[This link](/docs/input/inputfile/#input-file-structure) explains the structure of the input file in more detail.

####  3. _The **EXPRESS** category_

**blm**{: style="color: blue"} normally includes an **EXPRESS** category in _ctrl.pbte_{: style="color: green"}.

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('express'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click here
to see the beginning of the EXPRESS category.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="express">{:/} 

~~~
EXPRESS
# Lattice vectors and site positions
  file=   site

# Basis set
  gmax=   {gmax}                   # PW cutoff for charge density
  autobas[pnu=1 loc=1 lmto=5 mto=4 gw=0]
~~~ 

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

Tags in the **EXPRESS** category are effectively
aliases for tags in other categories, e.g. **EXPRESS_gmax** corresponds to
the same input as **HAM_GMAX**.  If you put a tag into **EXPRESS**, it will
be read there and ignored in its usual location; thus in this instance adding **GMAX**
to the **HAM** category would have no effect.

The purpose of **EXPRESS** is to simplify the input file,
collecting the most commonly used tags in one place.

####  4. _Determining what input an executable seeks_

**blm**{: style="color: blue"} builds input files with only a subset of the tags an executable will try to read.
Defaults are used for the vast majority of tags.
In any case each executable reads its own particular set, though most executables share many tags in common.

Executables accept input from two primary streams : tags in the ctrl file and additional information through command-line switches.

To see what an executable looks for in the ctrl file, invoke the executable with `--input`, e.g.

    $ lmchk --input

`--input` puts **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} in a special mode.  It doesn't attempt to read anything; instead, it prints out a (large) table of all the tags it would try to read, including a brief description of the tag, and then exits.

`$ lmchk --help` performs a similar function for the command line arguments: it prints out a brief summary of arguments effective in the executable you are using.

`$ lmchk --show` tells **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} to print out tags as it reads them (or the defaults it uses)

The remainder of this section is not essential to this tutorial and you can safely skip to section 5.  It explains what information is printed when you use
`--input`; it is useful if you want to see how tags and categories are organized, and how missing or partial tags are handled.

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('input'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">Click 
here for a description of the `--input` function.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="input">{:/} 

Below is snippet of output from `lmchk --input`:


~~~

      Supply one number for all vectors or a separate number for each vector.
~~~ 

**lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} prints the full name of each tag, e.g. **SPEC_ATOM** and **SPEC_ATOM_Z**, 
even though components of the tag are separated in the ctrl file.  _ctrl.pbte_{: style="color: green"} contains these lines

    SPEC 
      ATOM=Pb         Z= 82  R= 3.044814  LMX=3  LMXA=4

Many tags (**SPEC_SCLWSR**, **SPEC_ATOM_LMX**, **SPEC_ATOM_LMXA**) are optional:
**lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} will substitute defaults if you don't supply them.
Those marked **reqd** (**SPEC_ATOM**, **SPEC_ATOM_Z**, **SPEC_ATOM_R**) you must supply.

The cast (real, integer, character) of each tag is indicated, and also how many numbers are to be read.
Sometimes tags will look for more than one number, but allow you to supply fewer.
For example, **BZ_NKABC** looks for three numbers to determine the k-mesh, which are the number of divisions only each of the reciprocal lattice vectors.
If you supply only one number it is copied to elements 2 and 3.

####  4. _Initial setup_
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#initial-setup
{:/comment}

To carry out a self-consistent calculation, we need to prepare the following:

4.1  Find any high-lying core states that should be included in the valence as local orbitals.  
4.2  Make atomic densities, which **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} will overlap to make a starting trial density  
4.3  Provide a reasonable basis set with parameters **RSMH** and **EH** defining the envelope functions  
4.4  Supply an automatic estimate for the mesh density plane wave cutoff **GMAX**.

**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} is a tool that will provide all of this information automatically.
It will writes writes basis set information to template _basp0.pbte_{: style="color: green"},
The Questaal package reads from _basp.pbte_{: style="color: green"}, but it is written to
file basp0 to avoid overwriting a file you may want to preserve.  You can customize the 
basis set by editing the file.

As a first step, do:

~~~
$ lmfa ctrl.pbte                                #use lmfa to make basp file, atm file and to get gmax
$ cp basp0.pbte basp.pbte                       #copy basp0 to recognised basp prefix   
~~~

#####  4.1 Local orbitals
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#local-orbitals/
{:/comment}


Part of **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"}'s function is to identify
_local orbitals_ that [extend the linear method](/docs/package_overview/#linear-methods-in-band-theory).
Linear methods are reliable only over a limited energy window; certain elements may require an extension
to the linear approximation for accurate calculations.  This is accomplished with
[local orbitals](/docs/package_overview/#linear-methods-in-band-theory).
**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} will automatically look for atomic levels that
if certain criteria are satisfied (as described in "lmfa output" below) it designates as a local orbital,
and includes this information in the basp0 file.

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('localorbitals'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">
Click here for a description of how local orbitals are specified in the basp file.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="localorbitals">{:/} 

Inspect _basp.pbte_{: style="color: green"}.  Note in particular this text connected with the Pb atom:  

~~~
    PZ= 0 0 15.934
~~~

**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} is suggesting that the Pb 5_d_ state is shallow enough that it be included in the valence.  Since this state
is far removed from the fermi level, we would badly cover the hilbert space spanned by Pb 6_d_ state were we to use Pb 5_d_ as the valence partial
wave. (In a linear method you are allowed to choose a single energy to construct the partial wave; it is 
usually the "valence" state, which is near the Fermi level.)

This problem is resolved with local orbitals : these are partials wave at an energy far removed from the Fermi level.
The three numbers following **PZ**
correspond to specifications for local orbitals in the _s_, _p_, and _d_ channels.  Zero indicates "no local orbital;"
there is only a _d_ orbital here.

**15.934** is actually a compound of **10** and the "[continuous principal quantum number](/docs/code/asaoverview/#augmentation-sphere-boundary-conditions-and-continuous-principal-quantum-numbers)"
**5.934**. The 10's digit tells **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}
to use an "enhanced" local orbital as opposed to the usual variety found in most
density-functional codes.  Enhanced orbitals append a tail so that the
density from the orbital spills into the interstitial. 
You can specify a "traditional" local orbital by omitting the 10, but this kind is more accurate, and there is no advantage to doing so.

The continuous principal quantum number (**5.934**) specifies the [number of nodes and boundary
condition](/docs/code/asaoverview/#augmentation-sphere-boundary-conditions-and-continuous-principal-quantum-numbers).  The large fractional part
of _P_ is [large for core states](/docs/code/asaoverview/#continuous-principal-quantum-number-for-core-levels-and-free-electrons), typically
around 0.93 for shallow cores.  **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} determines the proper value for the atomic potential.  In the
self-consistency cycle the potential will change and **lmf**{: style="color: blue"} will update this value.

**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} automatically selects the valence-core partitioning; the information is given in _basp.pbte_{: style="color: green"}.
You can set the partitioning manually by editing this file.  

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} high-lying states can also be included as local orbitals; they improve on the hilbert
space far above the Fermi level. In the LDA they are rarely needed and **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} will not add them
to the _basp.pbte_{: style="color: green"}.  But they can sometimes be important in _GW_ calculations, since in contrast to
the LDA, unoccupied states also contribute to the potential.

##### 4.2 Valence-core partitioning of the free atomic density
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#4.2-valence-core-partitioning-of-the-free-atomic-density/
{:/comment}

After _basp.pbte_{: style="color: green"} has been modified, you must run **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} a second time

~~~
$ lmfa ctrl.pbte
~~~

This is necessary whenever the valence-core partitioning changes through the addition or removal of a local orbital.

##### Relativistic core levels
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#relativistic-core-levels/
{:/comment}

Normally **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} determines the core levels and core density from
the scalar Dirac equation.  However there is an option to use the full Dirac equation.

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('diraccore'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">
Click here to about calculating core levels from the Dirac equation.</div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="diraccore">{:/} 

Tag **HAM_REL** controls how the Questaal package manages different levels of relativistic treatment.
Run `lmfa --input` and look for **HAM_REL**.  You should see:

~~~
 HAM_REL                opt    i4       1,  1     default = 1
   0 for nonrelativistic Schr&ouml;dinger equation
   1 for scalar relativistic Schr&ouml;dinger equation
   2 for Dirac equation (ASA only for now)
   10s digit 1: compute core density with full Dirac equation
   10s digit 2: Like 1, but neglect coupling (1,2) pairs in 4-vector
~~~

Set **HAM_REL=11** to make **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} calculate the core levels and core density with the full Dirac
equation.

You might want to see the core level eigenvalues; they can shift significantly relative to the scalar Dirac solution.
Also, _l_ is no longer a good quantum number so there can be multiple eigenvalues connected with
the scalar Dirac _l_.   To see these levels, invoke **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} 
with a sufficiently high verbosity.  In the present instance insert
**HAM REL=11** into _ctrl.pbte_{: style="color: green"} and do

~~~
$ lmfa --pr41 ctrl.pbte
~~~

You should see the following table:

The scalar Dirac Pb 5_d_ eigenvalue (**-1.566638 Ry**) gets split into 6 levels with energy **-1.485638 Ry** and four with
**-1.676716 Ry**.  The mean (**-1.56207 Ry**) is close to the scalar Dirac value.  In the absence of a magnetic field a
particular _l_ will split into two distinct levels with degeneracies 2_l_ and 2_l_+2, respectively.

The bottom part of the table shows how much the free atom's total energy changes as a consequence of the fully
relativistic Dirac treatment.

**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} loops over each species, generating a 
self-consistent density from the charges given to it.  Core levels
are assumed to be filled; you supply the charges
of the valence _s_, _p_, ... orbitals.
The Pb atom, for example has  atomic configuration of $$s^2p^2d^{10}$$ 
and **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"}'s printout for Pb begins with:

~~~

The first lines show the augmentation radius and radial mesh parameters.  It uses a shifted logarithmic mesh: point _i_ has a radius

$$ r_i = b[exp^{a(i-1)}-1] $$

The **Pl** are the [continuous principal quantum numbers](/docs/code/asaoverview/#boundary-conditions-and-continuous-principal-quantum-numbers).
Note that because 5_d_ states are included in the valence through local orbitals, it treats the 5_d_ as valence with 10 electrons.

You can specify the charges **Ql** in the ctrl file; if you do not it has a lookup table of default values for every atom.

The **Ql** and the boundary condition (wave function decays exponentially as <i>r</i>&rarr;&infin;) are sufficient to completely determine
the charge density.

**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} starts with a crude guessed density and after 55 iterations converges to the self-consistent one.

Next follow information about the eigenvalues of the valence and core states it finds along with some additional information, such as
what fraction of the state falls outside the augmentation radius.

For Pb 5_d_, **0.007786** electrons spill out: this is on the ragged edge of whether it needs to be included as a local orbital (see Additional Exercises).
_Note:_{: style="color: red"} for _GW_ calculations this state is too shallow to be treated as a core.

Next **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} finds parameters related to the local orbitals: what shape of envelope function is needed to fit the
tail (**Eh** and **Rsm**), the "continuous principal quantum number" **Pnu**, and finally an estimate for plane wave cutoff **Gmax** that will be
needed for the density mesh.

~~~

~~~

Next **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} finds corresponding parameters for the valence envelope functions.
This constitutes a reasonable (but not optimal) guess for the shape of crystal envelope functions.

The basis data for the valence and local orbitals is later written to the basp0 file.

It searches for core states which are shallow enough to be treated as local orbitals,
using the core energy and charge spillout as criteria.

~~~
 Find local orbitals which satisfy E > -2 Ry  or  q(r>rmt) > 5e-3

 l=3  eval=-9.796  Q(r>rmt)=3e-8  PZ=4.971  Use: PZ=0.000
~~~

We had already specified that the Pb 5_d_ as a local orbital, information obtained from a prior run.  **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} uses
this information to appropriately partition the valence and core densities.

As a last step it fits the valence and core densities to a linear combination of smooth Hankel functions.
This information will be used to overlap free-atomic densities to obtain a trial starting density.

{::nomarkdown}</div>{:/}

After looping over all species **lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} writes basis information to 
_basp0.pbte_{: style="color: green"}, atomic charge density data to file
_atm.pbte_{: style="color: green"}, and exits with the following printout:

~~~
 FREEAT:  estimate HAM_GMAX from RSMH:  GMAX=4.3 (valence)  7.8 (local orbitals)
~~~

This is the _G_ cutoff **gmax** that the ctrl file needs in the next section.  It determines the mesh spacing for the charge density.

####  5. _Self consistency_
{::comment}
/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#self-consistency
{:/comment}


We are almost ready to carry out a self-consistent calculation.
It proceeds in a manner [similar to the basic tutorial](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_tutorial/#tutorial).
Try the following:

~~~
$ lmf ctrl.pbte
~~~

**lmf**{: style="color: blue"} stops with this message:

~~~
 Exit -1 bzmesh: illegal or missing k-mesh
~~~

We haven't yet specified a k mesh: 
You must supply it yourself since there are too many contexts to supply a sensible default value.
In this case a k-mesh of 6&times;6&times;6
divisions is adequate.   With your text editor change **nkabc=0** in the ctrl file
to **nkabc=6*8, or alternatively assign variable **nkabc* on the command line (which is what this tutorial will do).

We also haven't specified the _G_ cutoff for the density mesh.  **blm**{: style="color: blue"} does not determine this parameter automatically
because it is sensitive to the selection of basis parameters, hich local orbitals are included.
**lmfa**{: style="color: blue"} conveniently supplied that information for us,
based in the shape of envelope functions it found.  In this case the valence
_G_ cutoff is quite small (**4.388**), but the Pb 5_d_ local orbital is a much sharper function,
and requires a larger cutoff (**7.8**).  You must use use the larger of the two.

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} if you change the shape of the envelope funnctions
you must take care that **gmax** is large enough. This is described in the 
lmf output below.

Change variable **gmax=0** in the ctrl file, or alternatively add a variable to the command line.
Now run

~~~
$ lmf ctrl.pbte -vnkabc=6 -vgmax=7.8
~~~

**lmf**{: style="color: blue"} should converge to self-consistency in 10 iterations.
At the end of the file it prints out

~~~
                ↓        ↓
 diffe(q)=  0.000000 (0.000005)    tol= 0.000010 (0.000030)   more=F
c nkabc=6 gmax=7.8 ehf=-55318.1620974 ehk=-55318.1620958
~~~

The first line prints out the change in Harris-Foulkes energy relative to the prior iteration and some norm of RMS change in the
(output-input) charge density (see arrows), followed by the tolerances required for self-consistency.

The last line prints out a table of variables you specify on the command line, and total
energies from the Harris-Foulkes and Kohn-Sham functionals.  Theses are different
functionals but they should approach the same value at self-consistency.
The **c** at the beginning of the line indicates that this iteration is self-consistent.
