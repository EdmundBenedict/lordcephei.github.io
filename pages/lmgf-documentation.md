### _Purpose_
_____________________________________________________________

This package implements the ASA local spin-density approximation using Green's functions. The Green's functions are contructed by approximating KKR multiple-scattering theory with an analytic potential function. The approximation to KKR is essentially similar to the linear approximation employed in band methods such as LMTO and LAPW. It can be shown that this approximation is nearly equivalent to the LMTO hamiltonian without the "combined correction" term. With this package a new program, **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} is added to the suite of executables. **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} plays approximately the same role as the LMTO-ASA band program **lm**{: style="color: blue"}: a potential is generated from energy moments $$Q_0$$, $$Q_1$$, and $$Q_2$$ of the density of states. in the same way as the **lm**{: style="color: blue"} code. You can use **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} to make a self-consistent density as you can do with **lm**{: style="color: blue"}. lmgf is a Green's function method: Green's functions have less information than wave functions, so in one sense the things you can do with lmgf are more limited: you cannot make the bands directly, for example. However **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} enables you do do things you cannot do with **lm**{: style="color: blue"}. The two most imprortant are:

+ Calculate magnetic exchange interactions 
+ Calculate magnetic susceptibility (spin-spin, spin-orbit, orbit-orbit parts)
+ Calculate properties of disordered materials, either chemically disordered or spin disorder from finite temperature, within the Coherent Potential Approximation, or CPA.
+ Calculate the ASA static susceptibility at $$q=0$$ to help converge calculations to self-consistency. 


### _Structure of Green's function program_
_____________________________________________________________

**lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} runs in much the same way as program **lm**{: style="color: blue"}. The band pass routine of **lm**{: style="color: blue"}, **bndasa.f**{: style="color: green"}, generates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can in turn generate the quantities of interest. **bndasa**{: style="color: green"} is replaced by a Green's function routine, **gfasa**{: style="color: green"}. **gfasa**{: style="color: green"} can generate output moments, DOS, density-matrix, etc., in the same way as **bndasa**{: style="color: green"} does.

In contrast to band methods (implemented in **lm**{: style="color: blue"}) where the Hamiltonian H is energy independent and all the bands are generated by diagonalizing H, Green's functions are calculated for a specific energy; information is extracted from G for a particular energy.

This fact highlights the strengths and weaknesses of a Green's function approach. Energy-integrated properties such as the moments, must be obtained by integrating over energy. Calculating G explicitly at a family of energies is more cumbersome than diaonalizing a hamiltonian. On the other hand, Green's function methods are naturally suited to contexts where the energy-dependence is needed anyway. CPA theory yields an energy-dependent potential; Green's functions are natural way to implement it. Similarly, noninteracting susceptibilities can be expressed as G×G (`×' implies either convolution or product depending on the space you are working in).

**lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} always loops over some energy contour; what contour you use depends on the context as described below. **gfasa**{: style="color: green"} accumulates various kinds of data for each mesh point, such as the point's contribution from energy moments used in an ASA self-consistent cycle. Finally an estimate for the Fermi level $$E_F$$ is determined using a from Pade approximation. If the original guess for $$E_F$$ is sufficiently close, the cycle is finished as in program **lm**{: style="color: blue"}. If the estimate is too far off, a new energy mesh is taken and the process repeated. 

### _Energy Contours, Potential Shifts and the Determination of the Fermi Level_
_____________________________________________________________

For energy-integrated properties, a very fine energy mesh would be required if the energy integration were carried out close to the real axis. It is much more efficient to deform the integration contour is deformed into an elliptical path in the complex plane, approaching the real axis only at the lower and upper integration limits.

To integrate quantities over occupied states, integration to the Fermi level $$E_F$$ is required. EF is not known but must be fixed by charge neutrality. Thus $$E_F$$ must be guessed at and iteratively refined until the charge neutrality condition is satisfied. **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} does not vary $$E_F$$; the user specifies it at the outset. Instead **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} looks for a constant potential shift that satisfies charge neutrality; this must be searched for iteratively. Both the potential shift and $$E_F$$ are maintained in a file **vshft.ext**{: style="color: green"}. Inspection of **vshft.ext**{: style="color: green"} may look unecessarily complicated; it's because you can use the file to add site-dependent shifts. **vshft.ext**{: style="color: green"} is also used by the layer Green's function code **lmpg**{: style="color: blue"}, which requires extra information about shifts on the left and right leads.

Metals and nonmetals are distinguished in that in the latter case, there is no DOS in the gap and therefore the Fermi level (or potential shift) cannot be specified precisely. 

**Metal case** (set by **BZ_METAL=1**): once the k- and energy-points are summed over and the deviation from charge neutrality is determined, the code will attempt to find the potential shift that fixes charge neutrality. It does this in one of two ways:

+ Using a Pade approximant, **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} interpolates the diagonal elements of G. The interpolation is used to evaluate the GF on the starting elliptical contour shifted rigidly by a constant, and the shift is iterated until the charge-neutrality condition is satisfied. At this stage, there are two possibilities:

  1\. repeat the integration of G over k and the energy contour with the constant shift added to the potential.
  2\. Assume that the Pade-approximant to the diagonal G is a sufficiently good estimate for the actual G. 
  
If the potential shift is larger than a user-specifed tolerance (see padtol in **GF_GFOPTS** below), option 1 is taken and the Pade shift re-evaluated. A new Pade estimate is made for the potential shift requiring charge neutrality, and it is tested once against the user-specified tolerance.

When the shift falls below the tolerance, option 2 is taken and **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} proceeds to the next step. The user is advised to monitor these shifts and the deviation from charge neutrality.

+ The charge is integrated in a contour near the real axis subsequent to the elliptical contour. In this mode, the determination of the potential shift is accomplished by continuing the integration contour on the real axis starting from the originally estimated Fermi level. A trapezoidal rule is used (or Simpson's rule using a Pade approximate for the midpoint), and new energy points are computed and integrals accumulated until charge neutrality is found. There is no iterative scheme as with the Pade approximation. This option tends to be a little less accurate than the Pade, but somewhat more stable as it is less susceptible to interpolation errors.

One last comment about the METAL case: by default the program will save the potential shift to use in the next iteration. You can suppress this save (see frzvc below), which again can be less accurate, but more stable. In particular if you are working with an insulator where stability can be an issue (determination of the Fermi level is somewhat ill conditioned), a stable procedure is to use this option together with second energy integration scheme described above (the integration contour on the real axis).

**Nonmetal case** (set by **BZ METAL=0**): **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} will not attempt to shift the potential, or ensure charge neutrality. The user is cautioned to to pay rather closer attention to deviations from charge neutrality. It can happen because of numerical integration errors, or because your assumed Fermi level does not fall within the gap. You can use **METAL=1** even if the material is a nonmetal.
