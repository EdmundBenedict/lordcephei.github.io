### _Preliminaries_
_____________________________________________________________
You should familiarize yourself with the contents of the [general command line options](/docs/commandline/general/) documentation and be aware of the capabilities of the _lmf_{: style="color: blue"} program in order to fully understand the options available.

It would also be wise to read up on the different input sources that _lmf_{: style="color: blue"} can read as some input options will pertain to specific input data. Details on these input sources can be found in the [Input file guide.](/docs/input/inputfile/)

### _Documentation_

    --rs=#1,#2,#3,#4,#5  Tells lmf what parts to read from the rst file.
                         #1=0: Do not read the restart file, but overlap free-atom densities.
                            1: Read restart data from binary rst.ext.
                            2: Read restart data from ascii rsta.ext.
                            3: Same as 0, but also tells lmf to overlap free-atom densities after a molecular 
                               statics or molecular dynamics step.
                            11 or 12: Same as 1, or 2 but additionally adjust the mesh density 
                               for shifts in site positions relative to those used in the
                               generation of the restart file. Note: see --rs switch #3 below
                               for which site positions the program uses. The same principle for
                               adjusting the density is used as in computing corrections
                               to the Helman-Feynman forces; see token FORCES= in HAM.
							
                            Additionally, if you read from rst or rsta you can add 10 to #1.
							
                         #2=0: Exactly as #1, except switches apply to writing. Value zero suppresses writing.
                            1: Write binary restart file rst (default).
                            2: Write ascii restart file rsta.
                            3: Write binary file to rst.#, where # = iteration number.
						   
                         #3=0: Read site positions from restart file, overwriting positions from input file
                               (this is the default).
                            1: Ignore positions in restart file.
						   
                         #4=0: Read guess for Fermi level and window from restart file, overwriting data
                               from input file. This data is needed when the BZ integration is
                               performed by sampling (this is the default).
                            1: Ignore data in restart file.
						   
                         #5=0: Read linearization pnu from restart file, overwriting data from input file
                               (this is the default).
                            1: Ignore pnu in restart file.
							
                     Default switches:
                     If not specified, lmf defaults to --rs=1,1,0,0,0
					
                     Look at lmf's standard output around lines
                         iors  : read restart file (binary, mesh density) It tells you what bits are read
                         and what is ignored.
					
    --rdbasp[:fn]    Tells the program to read basis parameters (input using tokens RSMH=,EH=,RSMH2=,EH2=,PZ= for
                     each atom in the ctrl file) from file ``basp'' (or optionally file ``fn'').
                     Parameters input in this mode supersedes parameters read from the ctrl file.
                     You can specify none, or any set of the sets (RSMH=,EH= ; RSMH2=,EH2=; PZ=)
                     for each species. Parameters not specified here default to what was specified in the ctrl file.
					 
	                 This switch (and --optbas described below) is a useful
                     way to get started when you don't know what to choose
                     for parameters in the basis set.
					 
    --optbas[:sort][:spec=name[,rs][,e][,l=###]...]
                     Operates the program in a special mode to optimize the total energy wrt parameters in
                     the basis set. lmf makes several band passes (not generating the output density
                     or adding to the save file), varying selected parameters belonging to
                     tokens RSMH= and EH= to minimize the total energy wrt these parameters.
                     Either the smoothing radius [,rs] or the energy [,e] must be selected for
                     optimization (you can select both). Select which l quantum numbers whose parameters
                     you want to optimize using ",l=##..", e.g. l=02. The optimization routine is rather
                     primitive, but it seems to work reasonably well. See the basis optimization tutorial
                     for a more complete description and an example.
					 
    --rpos=filename  Tells the program to read site positions from file <b>filename<b> after the ctrl file
                     has been read.
					 
    --wpos=filename  Tells the program to write site positions to file <b>filename</b> after a relaxation step.
					 
    --band[~option~option...] 
                     Tells lmf to generate energy bands instead of making a self-consistent calculation.
	                 The energy bands can be generated in one of several formats. See "Drawing Energy Bands" 
                     in the Functionality -> Physical Application tab for a detailed description
                     of the available options.
					 
    --pdos[:options] Tells lmf to generate weights for density-of-states resolved into partial waves,
                     See "Density Of States" in the Functionality -> Physical Application
                     tab for a detailed description of the available options.

					 
    --mull[:options] Tells lmf to generate weights for Mulliken analysis, described in this document.
	
    --cls[options]   Tells lmf to generate weights to compute matrix elements and weights for
                     core-level-spectroscopy. See subs/suclst.f for a description of options.
					 
    --wden[:options] Writes one plane of the charge density to disk, on a uniform of mesh of points.
                     Information for the plane is specified by three groups of numbers: the
                     plane is specified by three groups of numbers: the origin (i.e. a point through
                     which the plane must pass), a first direction vector with its number of points,
                     and a second direction vector with its number of points. Default values will be taken
                     for any of the three sets you do not specify. The density generated is the smooth
                     density, augmented by the local densities in a polynomial approximation
                     (see option core= below).
					 
                     The options are specifications (see below) and different options are separated by
                     delimiters (chosen to be ":" in this text; the delimiter actually taken, is the
                     first character after "wden").
					 
                     At present, there is no capability to interpolate the smoothed density to an arbitrary
                     plane, so you are restricted to choosing a plane that has points on the mesh.
                     Accordingly, all three groups of numbers are given sets of integers, as will be explained
                     below. Supposing your lattice vectors are p1, p2 and p3, which the smooth mesh
                     having (n1,n2,n3) divisions. Then the point (#1,#2,#3) corresponds to the Cartesian coordinate
                         #1/n1 p1 + #2/n2 p2 + #3/n3 p3
					 
                     Specify the origin (a point through which the plane
                     must pass) by
                         :o=#1,#2,#3
                     Default value: o=0,0,0.
					 
                     Specify the direction vectors by
                         :l1=#1,#2,#3[,#4]
                         :l2=#1,#2,#3[,#4]
						 
                     l1 and l2 specify the first and second direction vectors, respectively. The first three
                     numbers specify the orientation and the fourth specifies the "length". #1,#2,#3 select
                     the increments in mesh points along each of the three lattice vectors that define
                     the direction vector. Thus a direction vector in Cartesian coordinates is
                     
                         #1/n1 p1 + #2/n2 p2 + #3/n3 p3
                     The last number (#4) specifies how many points to take in that direction and therefore
                     corresponds to a length.
                     Default values:
                         l1=1,0,0,n1+1
                         l2=0,1,0,n2+1
						 
                     Other options:
					 
                     core=#   Specifies how local densities are to be included. Any local density added is
                              expanded as polynomial * gaussian, and added to the smoothed mesh density.
                          #=0 Includes core densities + nuclear contributions.
                          #=1 Includes core densities, no nuclear contributions.
                          #=2 Exclude core densities.
                          #=-1 No local densities to be included (only interstitial).
                          #=-2 Local density, with no smoothed part.
                          #=-3 Interstitial and local smoothed densities.
					   
                          Default: core=2
						  
                     fn=name  Specifies the file name for file I/O.
                              The default name is ``smrho''.
							  
                     Example: Use ``:'' as the delimiter, and suppose
                              n1=n2=48 and n3=120. The specification
                              :fn=myrho:o=0,0,60:l1=1,1,0,49:l2=0,0,1,121
                              writes 'myrho.ext' a mesh (49,121) points.
                              The origin (first point) lies at (p3/2).
                              The first vector points along (p1+p2), and
                              has that length; the second vector points
                              along p3, and has that length.
							  
    --window=#1,#2   Accumulates the density in an energy window
                     specified by the limits #1,#2. (This option is
                     intended to be used in conjunction with --wden). If
                     invoked, lmf exits after a single band pass.
				   
    --oldvc          Chooses nfp-style energy zero, which sets the cell
                     average of the potential to zero. NNormally the
                     average estat potential at the RMT boundary is
                     chosen to be the zero. That puts the Fermi level
                     near zero, like in the ASA.

##### _Interfacing With GW Self-Energy_
The _lmf_{: style="color: blue"} program can interface with the self-energy data generated by GW components of the suite. The following switches specifically relate to this interface

    --mixsig=#1[,#2] lmf takes a linear combination of the self-energy
                     read from one or two files. See here in the GW documentation.
					 
	--rsig[~options] Tells lmf about the form of the input self-energy file. See here in the GW documentation.
                     ~ascii   read sigm in ascii format (file name is
                     ~rs      read sigm in real space
                              If either of the preceding two switches is used, the file name changes;
                                   k-space  real-space
                                   binary     sigm      sigmrs
                                   ascii      sigma     sigmars
                     ~null    generate a null sigma consistent with the hamiltonian dimensions
                              Useful in combination with the sigma editor.
                     ~fbz     sigma is stored for k in the full Brillouin zone
					 
    --wsig[options]  lmf writes a possibly modified self-energy to file sigm2.ext and exits.
                     See here in the GW documentation.
					 
	--etot           Is a special mode designed to be used in conjuction
                     with the GW suite. It generates parameters for the
                     LDA total energy without disturbing the rst or mixing
                     files, or logging the energy in the save file.
