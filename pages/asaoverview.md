### _Introduction_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Questaal package has three codes that implement DFT in the Atomic
Spheres Approximation (ASA).  Formulated by O. K. Andersen in the
1970's to handle transition metals, the ASA overlaps the augmentation
spheres so that the interstitial volume is zero (there is a geometry
violation).  Moreover, the potential is assumed to be spherically
symmetric inside the spheres.

The ASA is very efficient, but its range of validity is limited.  This
is because the interstitial is omitted so spheres must fill space.
Hence, there is a geometry violation that becomes severe if the spheres
overlap too much. It works best for close-packed systems, and still
remains one of the best and most highly efficient approaches to
studying magnetic properties of transition metals and their alloys.  The
ASA package has a non-collinear framework and a fully relativistic Dirac branch.

Questaal's implementation uses the "tight-binding" form of
LMTO, sometimes called "second generation," a [linear
transformation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.53.2571)" of the
original basis set that makes Hankel functions short ranged.

**Note**{: style="color: red"} There is also a non self-consistent
implementation of Anderen's most recent basis, the 'NMTO'.  This code
should largely be regarded as experimental, as there are practical
pitfalls associated with it that haven't been fully worked out.

### _The ASA Suite_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
Questaal has three implementations of the ASA:

+ **lm**{: style="color: blue"}: a band method whose function is
similar to the full-potential program **lmf**{: style="color: blue"}.
It is interesting to compare the ASA band structure to the FP one, e.g. in PbTe.

+ **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"}: is a crystal code similar to
**lm**{: style="color: blue"}, but it uses a Green's function
formalism.  An extra energy integration (in addition to the k
integration) is required, which makes the program somewhat slower.
However it has features **lm**{: style="color: blue"} does not: it can
calculate magnetic exchange interactions and some other properties of
linear response.  This code can include spin-orbit coupling
perturbatively, and has a fully relativistic Dirac
formulation.  It also implements the Coherent Potential Approximation,
either for the study of alloys, or for disordered local moments, or a
combination of the two.

+ **lmpg**{: style="color: blue"}: is an analog of
**lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} for layered systems.  Periodic boundary conditions are used in two
dimensions, and a Principal Layer technique is used for the third dimension. This is
advantageous because (1) boundary conditions in this dimension semi-infinite leads,
corresponding to layered systems and (2) the computation time scales only linearly in the number of
principal layers.  It can be used in a self-consistent framework, and also to
calculate transmission using Landauer-Buttiker theory.  There is a
non-equilibrium Keldysh formulation of the ASA hamiltonian of the theory
described in [this paper](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.195422).

In more detail, the system is divided up into three regions, two
contacts and a central device region. The two contact regions are
taken to extend to infinity in the third dimension. The device region
is divided up into a series of layers where only nearest neighbor
interactions between layers are considered. Greenâ€™s function
approaches are a natural choice for transport calculations since the
information on the contacts can be incorporated into the Hamiltonian
for the device region through an additional self energy
term. **lmpg**{: style="color: blue"} has been used to examine
transport in devices ranging from magnetic tunnel junctions to atomic
point contacts.

### _Structure of the ASA_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#structure-of-the-asa/
{:/comment}

The ASA is like other [augmented wave methods](/docs/package_overview/#augmented-wave-methods) which divide into an
"atomic'' part which makes matrix elements and a "band'' part which generates bands, densities-of-states, etc.
The ASA makes two simplifications to the atomic part that make the method highlty efficient:

1. The nonspherical part of the density and potential are neglected.
2. The spheres are overlapped so that they fill space.  
   The net interstitial volume is zero, and in the pure ASA it is neglected all together.

Both atomic and band parts become simpler than in full potential methods. Matrix elements of the potential become quite
simple and reduce to a few parameters (the "potential parameters"). The band part need only generate the lowest three energy moments
$$Q_0$$, $$Q_1$$, and $$Q_2$$ of the density as described below; this is sufficient for the atomic part to construct a density and make
potential parameters.  In the self-consistency cycle the atomic part takes moments and generates
potential parameters; the band part takes potential parameters and generates moments.

Self-consistency proceeds by alternating between the solid part and atomic part, generating moments, then potential
parameters, then moments again until the process converges.  The program can be started either with the band part,
specifying potential parameters, or with the atomic part, specifying the moments.

### _Augmentation sphere boundary conditions and continuous principal quantum numbers_
________________________________________________________________________________________________

{:/comment}

[Linear augmented wave](/docs/package_overview/#linear-methods-in-band-theory) methods almost invariably construct the basis set inside
augmentation spheres from the spherical part of the potential.  (In the ASA the potential is spherical anyway).
For a fixed spherical potential, the Schrodinger equation separates into an angular part
(whose solutions are spherical harmonics) and a radial part with quantum number _l_.  Solution to the radial Schrodinger
equation (aka "partial wave") <i>&phi;<sub>l</sub></i> and its energy are uniquely determined by the boundary
condition at the augmentation radius _s_.  More precisely, <i>&phi;<sub>l</sub></i> is called a <i>partial wave</i> since it is only a partial solution
to the full Schrodinger equation.  Partial waves must be matched to the envelope function at the augmentation sphere radius; the condition
that all partial waves match smoothly and differentiably at all surfaces is the quantization condition that determines allowed eigenvalues.
[Linear methods](/docs/package_overview/#linear-methods-in-band-theory) in fact require the partial wave $$\phi$$ and its energy derivative
$$\dot\phi$$ (or possibly $$\phi$$ at two different linearization energies.

The boundary condition can be given through the "logarithmic derivative function"

$$ D_l(\varepsilon) \equiv D\{\phi_l(\varepsilon)\} 
   = \left({\frac{d\ln\phi_l(\varepsilon,r)}{d\ln r}} \right)_{s}
   = \left( {\frac{r}{\phi_l(\varepsilon,r)}}
           {\frac{d\phi_l(\varepsilon,r)}{dr}} \right)_{s} . $$

The energy <i>&epsilon;</i> fixes _D_, or alternatively _D_ can be specified which fixes <i>&epsilon;</i>.
<i>D<sub>l</sub></i> is a cotangent-like function: it decreases monotonically from (+&infin;,&minus;&infin;)
over a finite window of energy, after which it starts again at +&infin;.
There is thus a multiplicity of energies for a given <i>D<sub>l</sub></i>, one branch for each principal quantum number.

For that reason the Questaal package uses a "continuous principal quantum number" defined as

$$P_l = 0.5 - \arctan(D_l)/\pi + \hbox{(principal quantum number)} $$

<i>P<sub>l</sub></i> increases smoothly and monotically with energy, acquiring an extra integer each time a new node appears.
This construction is due to Michael Methfessel. <i>P<sub>l</sub></i> called a "continuous principal quantum number."

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} <i>P<sub>l</sub></i> should not be confused with O.K. Andersen's "Potential function."
It is unfortunate that these distinct but related functions have the same symbol.

<button type="button" class="button tiny radius">Click here for a description of <i>P</i> for two limiting cases: core levels and free electrons.</button>
</div>{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="corep">{:/} 

_Core levels_

A core state is exponentially decaying as it approaches _s_; therefore its logarithmic derivative <i>D<sub>l</sub></i> is approximately
<i>s</i>/<i>&epsilon;<sub>l</sub></i>, which is large and negative.  Using the fact that arctan(<i>x&rarr;-&infin;</i>)/<i>&pi;</i>&rarr;-1/2,
the fractional part of <i>P<sub>l</sub></i> is large and close to one.

_Free electrons_

In the absence of a potential the partial wave has the shape <i>r<sup>l</sup></i>.
Thus for free electrons, $${\rm frac}[P_l^{\rm free}] = 0.5 - \arctan(l)/\pi$$.
This sets a lower bound to $$P_l$$. For _l_=0, $$P_l^{\rm free}{=}1/2$$; for large _l_,
$$P_l^{\rm free}$$ is small (0.15 for _d_ waves and 0.10 for _f_ waves).

In summary, the fractional part of <i>P<sub>l</sub></i> is close to one for
for deep states far below the Fermi level, for states far above the Fermi level it is small, at least for 
_l_>0.  As <i>&epsilon;</i> increases from -<i>&infin;</i> to <i>&infin;</i>, _P_ changes
in a continous way, acquiring an extra integer each time a new node appears.

### _Generation of the sphere potential and energy moments Q_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#generation-of-the-sphere-potential-and-energy-moments-q/
{:/comment}


Because the method is a linear one, and because the density is
constrained to be spherical, only three functions can carry charge
inside a sphere per <i>l</i> channel 
(<i>&phi;<sub>l</sub></i><sup>2</sup>,
<i>&phi;<sub>l</sub></i>&times;(<i>d&phi;<sub>l</sub></i>/<i>d&epsilon;</i>),
(<i>d&phi;<sub>l</sub></i> /<i>d&epsilon;</i>)<sup>2</sup>) and therefore the properties of a
sphere, for a spherical potential and a linear method are completely
determined by the first three energy moments <i>Q</i><sub>0</sub>,
<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, and <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> of the density of states for each <i>l</i>
channel, which are called the atomic number and the boundary
conditions at the surface of the sphere.  In some sense these numbers
are ''fundamental'' to a sphere; the atomic program will generate a
self-consistent potential for a specified set of <i>Q</i><sub>0</sub>,
<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> and boundary conditions, specified 
in the Questaal package through the continuous principal quantum number <i>P</i>
described in the previous section.  
This simplification depends on assumption of spherical densities, and is
unique to the ASA.  Information spcifying the potential is carried compactly in
the four numbers <i>P,&nbsp; Q<sub>0...2</sub></i> in each _l_ channel.

This is a generalization of the free-atom case where the atomic
density is determined by the zeroth moment <i>Q</i><sub>0</sub> in each _l_ channel
and the boundary condition that <i>&phi;<sub>l</sub></i> decay as
<i>r</i>&rarr;&infin;.  Only <i>Q</i><sub>0</sub> is needed because the atomic
level is sharp, having no energy dispersion. Also the boundary condition is fixed
by the requirement that <i>&phi;</i> is integrable.

_Potential Parameters_
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#potential-parameters/
{:/comment}

Once a potential is specified (implicitly through <i>P, Q</i><sub>0,1,2</sub>%nbsp;),
"potential parameters" can be generated.  They
are a compact representation of information needed 
specify the hamiltonian.  A description of how the
parameters are generated and their significance is too involved to be
described in this overview, but see 'Other Resources" below.
The most important parameters are the "band center of gravity" <i>C<sub>l</sub></i>
and the bandwidth &Delta;<i><sub>l</sub></i>.

+ <i>C<sub>l</sub></i> describes the band center, and is the analog of the on-site matrix element (or atomic level in the free atom)
+ &Delta;<i><sub>l</sub></i> characterises the width of the partial, i.e. approximately the maximum and minimum values a partial wave would take in the absence of hybridization with other atoms.

For a connection between _C_ and &Delta; and scattering phase shifts, see [downfolding](/docs/code/asaoverview/#downfolding-in-the-asa/) below.
Another useful quantity is the "small parameter" _p_, which tells you the energy window over which the 
[partial wave is well described by the linear method](/docs/package_overview/#linear-methods-in-band-theory "linear methods")

To generate bands and an output charge density (in the form of moments <i>Q</i><sub>0,1,2</sub>), only potential parameters are required.
Nevertheless it is more common to start from the moments because rough values for them can easily be guessed.  The ASA codes will assume default
values (<i>Q</i><sub>0</sub> = occupation of the free atom, <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> = 0), which most of the time is good
enough to reach self-consistency.  These codes also have a lookup table for default values of _P_ described
[above](/docs/code/asaoverview/#augmentation-sphere-boundary-conditions-and-continuous-principal-quantum-numbers).

### _Selection of Sphere Radii_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#selection-of-sphere-radii
{:/comment}

One of the biggest nuisances for augmented-wave programs is the choice
of sphere radius.  Results are much more sensitive to choice of
spheres in the ASA than in the full-potential case, in part because
the energy functional (and potential) change with MT radii, whereas in
the FP case, this only weakly so.  The ASA also has the additional constraint
that the sum-of-sphere volumes equals the unit cell volume, so the
criteria in selecting them is somewhat different.

For either the ASA or FP, the Questaal package has several tools to help you select radii automatically.  

+ The input file maker, **blm**{: style="color: blue"}, automatically selects them.  Many tutorials, such as 
the basic [**lmf**{: style="color: blue"}](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_tutorial/)
and [**lm**{: style="color: blue"}](/tutorial/asa/lm_pbte_tutorial) tutorials,
start with **blm**{: style="color: blue"}.
+ If you want to modify a ctrl file you already have, the geometry checker **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} will find radii (`lmchk --getwsr`) 
+ Questaal programs can rescale preselected sphere radii up to a specified volume within constraints you supply.

Finding sphere radii automatically is relatively straightforward in the FP case; the ASA can be tricky
because of the space-filling requirement.

<button type="button" class="button tiny radius">Click here for for a discussion of the (in part competing) criteria for the selection of sphere radii.</button>
</div>{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="sphereradii">{:/} 

Geometry violation of overlapping spheres
: Overlapping spheres count some parts of space twice and others not at all. The full-potential code has a unique augmentation,
constructed so that the sphere contributions vanish quadratically for radii approaching the MT radius. Overlap errors tend to be small until
overlaps reach about 10% of the internuclear distance. It has been found empirically, however, that self-consistency proceeds more slowly
when spheres overlap.  _Note:_{: style="color: red"} the current _GW_ implemntation doesn't have this property: there, spheres should _not_ overlap.

: The ASA band code **lm**{: style="color: blue"}, has a "combined correction" term that partially reverses this
error, but not completely. The Green's function codes **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmpg**{: style="color: blue"}
do not have this term.

ASA Requirement for space-filling spheres
: The ASA functional requires that the sum-of-sphere volumes equals the cell volume.  More precisely, the density is carried by
the spheres (superposition of spherically symmetrical sphere densities).   This criterion mitigates directly against the preceding one.
The more closely packed a system is the better suited the ASA.  For open systems, you must add "empty spheres:" fictitious atoms of zero atomic number that
enable space to be filled without too large a geometry violation.

Large sphere radii assign more volume to augmented functions
: Augmented wave functions are very accurate, and the more space covered
  by them the more reliable the basis set.

_l_-convergence is most rapid for small sphere radii
: The larger the sphere radius, the slower the convergence with _l_, because
the angular momentum increases rapidly with _l_.

Larger spheres better contain shallow semicore states
: Ideally the core is completely localized within augmentation spheres.
Particularly in the full-potential case where spheres overlap less
than in the ASA, shallow semicore states can be an issue. In the FP case, 
you can always add 
[a local orbital](/tutorial/lmf/lmf_pbte_tutorial/#local-orbitals/)
to address this problem.

MT potentials are exactly solvable
: The KKR method is essentially exact for a MT potential, i.e. one
  that is spherical inside augmentation spheres and approximately flat in the
  interstitial. The LMTO basis starts from the KKR basis; thus a
  partitioning of space which best resembles a MT potential is the
  best choice. The automatic sphere radii algorithms try to select
  radii that make the intersitial potential flat.

#### _Algorithm to automatically determine sphere radii_
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#algorithm-to-automatically-determine-sphere-radii/
{:/comment}

The ideal choice of sphere radii best approximates a potential that is spherical within the augmentation spheres and flat outside.  
**blm**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} use an algorithm that makes a reasonable initial choice: they compute the
(electrostatic) potential obtained from overlapping free-atom densities along all connecting vectors between a given site and its relatively
near neighbors. The augmentation radius is taken as the first potential maximum along any ray. This choice is a pretty reasonable estimate for the
potential being approximately spherical inside. Also, for a completely symmetric bond, the potential maximum will fall exactly midway
between the bond, so for that case the two sphere radii will exactly touch and have equal potentials.  

+ **blm**{: style="color: blue"} uses this algorithm automatically
+ **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} will run the algorithm and print the results to stdout if you invoke it with `lmchk --getwsr ...`\\
  You must use your editor to copy each radius to the appropriate **SPEC_ATOM_RMAX** tag in the ctrl file.\\
  There is at present no automatic way to incorporate radii generated by **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"}'s output into the input system.

#### _Autoscaling of sphere radii_
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#autoscaling-of-sphere-radii/
{:/comment}

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} this should be moved to an **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"} tutorial.

Questaal programs can scale sphere radii as large as possible within constraints you supply. This option iteratively adjusts sphere radii
as large as it can within certain constraints, or until the aggregate sphere volumes equal the target you set. To autoscale sphere
radii, set **SPEC_SCLWSR**=_f_, where _f_ is the target aggregate sphere volumes as a fraction of the cell volume.  For the ASA, _f_ should
be 1.  You can use it for the FP codes too, but it usually isn't necessary.

The overlap between spheres at sites <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> is defined as <i>o<sub>ij</sub></i> = (<i>s<sub>i</sub></i>+<i>s<sub>j</sub></i>&minus;<i>d<sub>ij</sub></i>)
where <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> is the augmentation radius for sphere <i>i</i> and <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i> the distance between sites <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.
The constraints on <i>o<sub>ij</sub></i> come in the following flavors (all of them are imposed):

Constraints on sphere overlaps
: There are constraints on sphere overlaps set through tags **SPEC_OMAX1** and **SPEC_OMAX2**.\\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>o<sub>ij</sub></i> / <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i> is constrained to be less than **OMAX1**\\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>o<sub>ij</sub></i> / min(<i>r<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>r<sub>j</sub></i>) is constrained to be less than **OMAX2**

Maximum sphere radius
: Cap the maximum sphere radius by setting **SPEC_WSRMAX**\\
  Lock sphere radii of specific species, by setting **SPEC_ATOM_CSTRMX**  in any species you want to freeze.

#### _Finding empty spheres_
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#finding-empty-spheres/
{:/comment}

You can use "empty spheres" as a device to fill space.  The ASA constraint that
the aggregate sphere volume to match the cell volume
can only be realized with reasonable sphere overlaps (<18%) for
fairly close-packed systems.  The geometry violation for open
systems, e.g. Si, is too severe.  To use the ASA for such systems
you must pack the volume with "atoms" with
atomic number zero ("empty spheres").  This can be tedious, but 
**blm**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmchk**{: style="color: blue"}
have an automatic "empty sphere" finder that can greatly facilitate this step.
See [this tutorial](/tutorial/asa/lm_pbte_tutorial).

##### Assigning lower priority to resizing empty spheres
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#assigning-lower-priority-to-resizing-empty-spheres/
{:/comment}

Particularly in the ASA, empty spheres are often needed to get
reasonable sphere packing.  However, it is reasonable that their radii
should be scaled after the real spheres are rescaled.  You can tell
the resizer to do this through the 10's digit of tag **SPEC_SCLWSR**.  The
10's digit behaves like a flag to cause the resizer to treat empty spheres
on a different footing from real atoms.

+ Add  10 to **SPEC_SCLWSR** to initially scale real atoms (those with Z>0) first.
   The scaling is done using radii of size zero for all empty spheres.
   After this initial scaling, the resizer will proceed rescaling
   all the spheres.
+ Add 20 to **SPEC_SCLWSR** is similar to adding 10.  However, the final
  rescaling applies only to the empty spheres; the real atoms' spheres
  change only in the first scaling, without reference to the empty
  spheres.

### _Downfolding in the ASA_
________________________________________________________________________________________________
{::comment}
/docs/code/asaoverview/#downfolding-in-the-asa/
{:/comment}

The **lm**{: style="color: blue"} and **lmgf**{: style="color: blue"} codes
have procedures for constructing minimal basis by downfolding orbitals whose
center of gravity is far above the Fermi level.

<div onclick="elm = document.getElementById('downfolding'); if(elm.style.display == 'none') elm.style.display = 'block'; else elm.style.display = 'none';">
<button type="button" class="button tiny radius">
Click here for a discussion of downfolding in the ASA band program.</button></div>
{::nomarkdown}<div style="display:none;padding:0px;" id="downfolding">{:/} 

Downfolding is a procedure for constructing minimal basis sets and for
avoiding ghost bands. The best description is in Ole Andersen's
Varenna Notes (section 4.12), and for the stout-hearted, there is
a full account in Lambrecht and Andersen, [Phys. Rev. B, 34, 2439 (1986)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.34.2439).  
It is implemented in the ASA including the "combined correction" term.
We include in this documentation a 
[plain TeX source file of notes](../../../assets/download/docs/dnfpap.tex)
explaining in some detail how downfolding is implemented 
into the **lm**{: style="color: blue"} code.

One way to look at the scheme is the following.  When an electron
encounters an atomic sphere, the scattering it experiences can be
described in terms of its phase shift, <i>&eta;<sub>l</sub></i>. 
The tangent of the phase shift is a property of the scattering potential and the
angular momentum of the electron, _l_, and is a function of energy.
Some electrons are weakly scattered, while others (for example
_d_ electrons in transition metals) may scatter strongly,
especially when their energy is close to the resonant energy
<i>E<sub>l</sub></i>. 
In a linear method, the phase shift is parameterized:

$$ \tan \eta_l(E) = W_l / ( E_l  -  E) $$

so that one can construct an energy-independent hamiltonian. In
LMTO, it is customary to use the <i>&kappa;</i>=0 (<i>&kappa;</i><sup>2</sup> is the envelope function energy)
KKR phase shift in the following parameterization:

$$ 1 / P_l(E) = \Delta_l / ( E  -  C_l )  +  \gamma  \hspace{1cm}   (1)  $$

which is correct to second order in $$(E - C_l)$$.  Potential parameters *C* and &Delta; are readily identified by comparing the two
equations: &Delta; is the width *W* of the resonance, and *C* is the band center. &gamma; is the second order distortion parameter, which
can be seen to add a constant background to the phase shift. In practice, one can also include third order terms using the small parameter _p_;
see Varenna notes.

_Note:_{: style="color: red"} In (1), <i>P<sub>l</sub></i> is indeed Andersen's "potential function,"
_not_ the ["continuously varying principal quantum number"!](/docs/code/asaoverview/#augmentation-sphere-boundary-conditions-and-continuous-principal-quantum-numbers)
1/_P_ is the LMTO analogue of the tangent of the phase shift in multiple scattering and KKR theories.

For electrons that scatter only weakly, one can further
approximate the hyperbola (1) by a linear function. This is
exactly what happens if one throws away orbitals from the
basis---one approximates 1/*P* for these "high" partial waves by a
tangent drawn through the hyperbola (1) at the energy $$V^0$$, which
is the depth of a square well pseudopotential with the same
scattering properties as the atomic sphere for energy <i>E<sub>l</sub></i>. (If
the structure constants have been screened in these channels then
the tangent goes through the potential parameter $$V^{\alpha}$$.)

The best possible way to treat weakly scattered electrons is to
make the tangent at <i>E<sub>l</sub></i> since then the eigenvalues are exact at
<i>E<sub>l</sub></i>, and the wavefunctions are correct to zeroth order. The way
to do this, is to change the representation of the hamiltonian
before discarding the orbitals. The effect of using a
representation beta is to shift the inverse potential function
(1) rigidly by the amount beta. This is done by choosing a beta
such that $$V^{\rm beta}{=}E_l$$ so that when the orbitals are subsequently
discarded from the basis, this amounts to approximating their
scattering by a linear tangent to 1/P at <i>E<sub>l</sub></i>. This is called
folding down about 1/P(<i>E<sub>l</sub></i>).

If one merely wants to avoid ghost bands, then turn on **OPTIONS_ASA_ADNF**
and keep an eye on which orbitals are being folded down.
The automatic switch will choose to fold down about 1/P(<i>E<sub>l</sub></i>) or
about the screening parameter $$\alpha$$ depending on how weakly they are scattering. It is
often useful to set the switches manually as the criteria in the
automatic mode are set to cause no loss of accuracy. Very often
one can fold down orbitals and save a lot of time with only a
small error in the eigenvalues. Examples are _p_ orbitals in
transition metals and _d_ orbitals in Al. In Fe, the _f_ orbitals
must be folded down to avoid a ghost band. Another application is
in constructing minimal basis sets. As an exercise try folding
down orbitals in Si right down to _s_ and _p_ on the atoms and _s_ in
the empty spheres (these are the analogues of Vogl's _sp_<sup>3</sup>s\*
basis). Now try folding down the empty sphere _s_ as well: any
worse than Harrison's minimal basis? (Try the deformation
potentials!)
